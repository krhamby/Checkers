# Checkers

## Description

A checkers game written in Python using Pygame for the UI. It can be played with two human players, a human player against an AI, or two AIs against each other. The AI utilize a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning--they look ahead by 8 ply in the provided executables (more below).

## Executables

There are three executables in this project:

1. `checkers` - a human vs. human game
2. `checkers_ai` - a human vs. AI game
3. `checkers_ai_ai` - an AI vs. AI game

## How to Play

Run the desired executable like you would any program. If you decide to watch the AI duke it out, sit back and relax; the program could run for a while. If you decide to play, just click the piece you want to move and then click the available highlighted square you want to move it to. If you are forced to capture your opponent's piece, you will only be able to highlight that piece.
